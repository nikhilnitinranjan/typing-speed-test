# typing-speed-test
Hey friends, 
today we see how to build a Typing Speed Test Game in HTML CSS & JavaScript.
  now it’s time to create a Typing Speed Test Game.

Typing speed test is a game where we can check your typing speed like WPM (Word Per Minute),
 CPM (Character Per Minute), Accuracy, etc.
 In my Typing Speed Test Game, the max time for typing is 60 seconds. 
 Once you start typing, you’ll see your time, mistakes, WPM, and CPM at the bottom.

We can also erase your incorrect characters or go backward by pressing the backspace key of your keyboard. 
Once we have typed all characters or the time is completed,
we can click on the try again button to reset the result and load a new paragraph.
